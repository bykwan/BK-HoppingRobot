# Modeling and Control of a Vertical Hopping Robot
This project was my (Bradley Kwan) Master's thesis at California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo. 
The goal of the thesis is to develop an accurate model of a vertical hopping robot within Simulink, allowing for controller development and comparison to a physical prototype.

## MATLAB Files
The following MATLAB files are used to run the Stateflow and Simscape simulations.
